Blockchain :

Blockchain technology has evolved significantly since its inception with the creation of Bitcoin. It has expanded to various types, each catering to different industry needs and requirements. This survey report delves into the various types of blockchains—public, private, and consortium—and explores their real-time use cases across different sectors.

Types :


Public Blockchain:

Public blockchains are open networks where anyone can participate, read, and write to the ledger. They operate on a decentralized model, offering high transparency and security. Notable examples include Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Real-time Use Cases:
Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others facilitate peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized financial services.
Voting Systems: Public blockchains offer transparent and secure voting systems, ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.
Decentralized Applications (dApps): These applications leverage public blockchains for functionalities ranging from finance to gaming and more.



Private Blockchain:

Private blockchains operate within a closed ecosystem where only authorized participants have access. They are often used by enterprises seeking control and privacy over their data and transactions.

Real-time Use Cases:
Supply Chain Management: Enterprises use private blockchains for tracking products, ensuring authenticity, and reducing fraudulent activities.
Financial Services: Banks and financial institutions use private blockchains for faster and more secure transactions.
Healthcare: Securing patient data and ensuring interoperability among healthcare providers are common uses of private blockchains.



Consortium Blockchain:

Consortium blockchains are semi-decentralized, involving a group of organizations rather than a single entity. They offer the benefits of decentralization while maintaining some level of control.

Real-time Use Cases:
Real Estate: Managing property records, facilitating transactions, and ensuring transparency among multiple stakeholders.
Supply Chain Collaboration: Multiple organizations involved in a supply chain use consortium blockchains for better coordination and transparency.
Legal and Compliance: Consortium blockchains assist in streamlining legal and compliance processes, ensuring secure data sharing among stakeholders.

hybrid blockchain

A hybrid blockchain is a combination of two or more types of blockchains, typically a mix of public and private or consortium blockchains. This approach allows organizations to leverage the strengths of both types while mitigating their weaknesses. Hybrid blockchains are designed to offer a flexible and customizable solution that can cater to various business needs and use cases.

real-world use cases for hybrid blockchains:

Supply Chain Management
Cross-Border Trade and Payments
Healthcare Data Management
Government Services
Tokenization of Assets
Educational Records and Credential Verification
IoT Data Management
Trade Finance
Voting Systems
Media and Entertainment Rights Management
