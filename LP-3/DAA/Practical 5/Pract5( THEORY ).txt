N-QUEEN THEORY :


The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem where you need to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. In your specific scenario, you have already placed the first queen, and you want to use backtracking to place the remaining queens to generate the final N-Queens matrix.


ALGORITHM :

Place the first queen in the first row of the first column.

Create a backtracking function placeQueens(row) to place queens in the subsequent rows, where row is the current row.

In the placeQueens function:
a. If row equals N, print the solution (all queens are placed).
b. For each column from 1 to N:
i. Check if it's safe to place a queen in the current row and column.
ii. If safe, place the queen and call placeQueens(row + 1) for the next row.
iii. If the call returns false, backtrack by removing the queen.

Start the backtracking process by calling placeQueens(2) (beginning from the second row).

Continue backtracking until all valid solutions are found or all possibilities are exhausted
