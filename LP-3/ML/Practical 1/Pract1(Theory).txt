
Data Preprocessing :

It involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis or model training. 
The goal is to improve data quality, remove inconsistencies, and prepare the data for accurate and effective analysis. 
Data pre-processing tasks can include data cleaning (handling missing values, correcting errors), data normalization (scaling features to a common range), feature selection (choosing relevant variables), encoding categorical data (converting non-numeric data into a numerical format), and more.

Outliers :

Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the data in a dataset. 
They can be exceptionally high or low values and can distort the results of data analysis or machine learning models. 
Outliers can occur due to errors in data collection.

Correlation :

Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the degree to which two or more variables are related to each other. 
It quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. 
Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, with -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, 1 indicating a perfect positive correlation, and 0 indicating no correlation.
Positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase, and negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.

Linear Regression : 

Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors or features). 
It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and aims to find a linear equation that best fits the data. 
The equation is used to make predictions based on the input features.

Random Forest Regression : 


Random Forest Regression is a machine learning algorithm that extends the concept of decision tree regression. It's used for solving regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous numeric value (e.g., predicting the price of a house, stock prices, or in your case, the price of an Uber ride).

MSE :The Mean Absolute Error is the squared mean of the difference between the actual values and predictable values.

RMSE :It calculates the square root of the mean of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.

R2 :The coefficient of determination, or R2 , is a measure that provides information about the goodness of fit of a model.



matplotlib: Matplotlib is a popular Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is commonly used for creating various types of plots and charts, such as line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more.


numpy: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.


pandas: Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame for handling and analyzing structured data. In your code, you use Pandas to read data from a CSV file 

seaborn: Seaborn is a data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

SimpleImputer: SimpleImputer is a class from the scikit-learn library, which is commonly used for machine learning in Python. It is used to handle missing data by filling in missing values with a specified strategy, such as mean, median, or constant values.


The IQR is defined as the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of a dataset.
            	Arrange the data in ascending order.
		Calculate the first quartile (Q1), which is the data point at the 25th percentile.
		Calculate the third quartile (Q3), which is the data point at the 75th percentile.
		Compute the IQR by subtracting Q1 from Q3: IQR = Q3 - Q1.
